# Portfolio
The source code for my portfolio website
The website is still in development, below is a list of features I still need to add to the website:<br/>
Full responsiveness for the sections on the homepage<br/>
Full responsiveness for the projects on the projects page<br/>
Background too small for monitors larger than 1920x1080, need to resize it for these cases.<br/>
Text when hovering over projects appears on top rather than middle, make that a standard for all of them (possibly utilising grid display)<br/>
Find a way to allow users to scroll past the bottom project, because if they can't the text is hard to read.<br/>
